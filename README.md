StopModReposts
==============
StopModReposts is a movement against illegal redistribution of Minecraft content, mainly focused on mods. The movement consists of a [website](http://stopmodreposts.org/), a [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopModReposts&src=savs), a [list of illegal mod mirrors](http://git.io/jaBI), and several browser plugins. We also have an [IRC channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=WebUser....&channels=StopModReposts&prompt=0) and a [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/StopModReposts).

To report a site that might be illegally redistributing mods, please open an issue in our [issue tracker](http://git.io/jaB7) or submit a pull request. We do currently target reposts of the following content types: mods, resource packs, maps, and modpacks. In addition, we target websites providing malicious Minecraft content.
